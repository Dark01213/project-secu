# --- External API configuration (placeholder) ---
# If your project uses a third-party API (SMS, email, maps, AI, etc.),
# add the API base URL and your API key here. Replace the example
# values below with the provider you use. Example providers: SendGrid,
# Mailgun, Twilio, Stripe, OpenAI, Mapbox, etc.

# The name of the external API / provider (purely informational)
EXTERNAL_API_PROVIDER=ExampleProvider

# The base URL (if needed) for API requests from the server
EXTERNAL_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Your secret API key for the provider. Example: "sk_..." or similar.
# IMPORTANT: keep this secret out of version control. Provide it only
# via your CI/CD / secrets manager or by setting it in the server
# environment (not committed into the repository).
EXTERNAL_API_KEY=change-me-to-your-api-key

# Usage notes (what we used and what to do):
# - In this project we do not ship a specific external provider by default.
#   If you integrate an external API (email/SMS/AI/payments), set the
#   corresponding `EXTERNAL_API_PROVIDER`, `EXTERNAL_API_URL`, and
#   `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` values above.
# - Where to use the key: on server-side code only (API routes under
#   `pages/api/`), never expose secret keys in client-side code.
# - How to create the key: follow your provider's dashboard to create
#   an API key (for example, in OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/).
# - For production: store secrets in a secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager,
#   Azure Key Vault, GitHub Actions secrets, Vercel/Netlify environment
#   variables) rather than in files.
# - After editing this file, copy it to `.env` (ignored by git) and
#   populate real values before running the app in development.
