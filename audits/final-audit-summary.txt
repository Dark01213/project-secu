Final Audit Summary - Checklist continuation
Date: 2025-12-04

Summary:
- Secrets removal: localhost-key.pem removed from repo and history. Proof: audits/key-removal.txt
- .gitignore updated to exclude local certs and audit archive. Proof: audits/gitignore.txt
- HTTPS local smoke-flow: attempted but connection refused (dev server / proxy not running). Proof: audits/smoke-flow-https.txt
- XSS final run: attempted but connection refused (dev server / proxy not running). Proof: audits/xss-final.txt
- Upload handlers: repository scan completed; no application-level upload endpoints found. Proof: audits/file-upload.txt
- Dependency audit: npm audit outputs saved. Proofs: audits/npm-audit.json, audits/npm-audit-after-next.json, audits/npm-audit.txt
- Password storage: bcrypt used. Proofs: audits/seed-todos.txt, audits/reset-user-password.txt
- CSRF and security headers: present and tested where reachable. Proofs: audits/xss-http.txt, audits/smoke-flow-https.txt
- Git push and commits: normal push and earlier force-push traces saved. Proofs: audits/git-push-readme.txt, audits/git-push.txt
- Archive of artifacts: audits/evidence.zip (contains audit outputs)

Remaining manual checks recommended (not yet proven automatically):
- RGPD / privacy page: add `/privacy` or `/legal` and capture screenshot as proof.
- Password policy (12+ and complexity): confirm signup validation and capture form/server validation outputs.

Next actions available (pick one):
1) I try to start the dev server + TLS proxy here and re-run the smoke-flow and XSS tests to obtain successful E2E proofs. (May require filling `.env` or running mkcert.)
2) You start the dev server and proxy locally and I re-run the tests to capture green outputs.
3) Proceed with current artifacts and finalize the checklist report (I can generate PDF/archive now).
